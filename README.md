# Twitter Customer Support NLP Workflow


## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling customer support interactions on Twitter. Using a large dataset of tweets and replies, the goal is to build a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that cleans, preprocesses, and models the text data to extract meaningful insights and support tasks such as sentiment analysis and conversational modeling.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is a CSV file where each row represents a single tweet. Each conversation includes at least one consumer request and one company response. Company user IDs can be identified using the `inbound` field.

### Key Columns:

- **tweet_id:** Unique anonymized ID for the tweet, linked by `response_tweet_id` and `in_response_to_tweet_id`.
- **author_id:** Anonymized user ID replacing Twitter handles to protect privacy.
- **inbound:** Indicates if the tweet is inbound to a company (customer message).
- **created_at:** Timestamp when the tweet was posted.
- **text:** Tweet content, with sensitive info masked (e.g., emails replaced by `__email__`).
- **response_tweet_id:** Comma-separated IDs of tweets responding to this tweet.
- **in_response_to_tweet_id:** ID of the tweet this one is replying to (if any).

## Text Preprocessing Steps

1. **Lowercasing:** Convert all text to lowercase to treat words like ‚ÄúText‚Äù and ‚Äútext‚Äù equally. (Note: Some vectorizers like `TfidfVectorizer` and Keras `Tokenizer` do this by default; it can be disabled if casing is meaningful, e.g., uppercase indicating anger.)

2. **Removal of Punctuation:** Use Python‚Äôs `string.punctuation` set, which can be customized by adding or removing characters as needed.

3. **Stopwords Removal:** Filter out common words such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúa‚Äù, and ‚Äúand‚Äù that do not add meaningful information.

4. **Removal of Frequent Words:** Identify and remove very common words in the corpus that add little value, unless using methods like TF-IDF which downweight these automatically.

5. **Removal of Rare Words:** Remove words that appear very infrequently (e.g., once or twice) to reduce noise and dimensionality.

6. **Stemming:** Reduce words to their root by chopping off suffixes (e.g., ‚Äúwalking‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúwalk‚Äù).

7. **Lemmatization:** More sophisticated than stemming, it reduces words to their valid base form or lemma (e.g., ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúgood‚Äù) using resources like NLTK‚Äôs `WordNetLemmatizer`.

8. **Handling Emojis and Emoticons:** Instead of removing them, convert emojis and emoticons into descriptive words to preserve sentiment information (e.g., üòÇ ‚Üí "laughing face", `:)` ‚Üí "happy face").

9. **Removal of URLs:** Strip out links from tweets as they usually add noise without meaningful content.

10. **Removal of HTML Tags:** Clean any leftover HTML tags such as `<div>`, `<br>`, etc.

11. **Chat Words Conversion:** Translate chat abbreviations and slang (e.g., ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúyou‚Äù, ‚Äúbrb‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúbe right back‚Äù) into their full forms for clarity.

12. **Spelling Correction:** Fix typos and misspellings to standardize the text, improving model understanding and accuracy.

## Why These Steps Matter

- **Improved Analysis:** Removing noise like frequent or rare words sharpens focus on important content, aiding sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
- **Reduced Dimensionality:** Filtering unnecessary words simplifies data and speeds up machine learning processing.
- **Customization:** The process is flexible, allowing threshold adjustments for what counts as frequent or rare words based on the dataset.
- **Preserving Sentiment:** By converting rather than removing emojis and emoticons, valuable emotional cues are retained for better sentiment insights.
